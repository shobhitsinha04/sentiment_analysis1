**Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews**
This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using two popular models: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach). The primary goal of this project is to compare the performance of these two sentiment analysis methods in accurately classifying the sentiment of customer reviews. By leveraging both rule-based (VADER) and deep learning-based (RoBERTa) approaches, this project aims to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model and their applicability to real-world data.

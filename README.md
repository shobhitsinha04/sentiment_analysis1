**Sentiment Analysis Using VADER and RoBERTa**



This repository contains projects that perform sentiment analysis on different datasets, including Amazon reviews and tweets, using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach). By leveraging both rule-based (VADER) and deep learning-based (RoBERTa) approaches, these projects aim to compare the performance of the models in accurately classifying sentiment and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses.


**Models Used**
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

**RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach)**
RoBERTa is a transformer model developed by Facebook AI, which builds on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by optimizing the training process and using more data.

**Key Features:**

Sentiment analysis using VADER and RoBERTa.
Comparison of model performance.
Visualization of sentiment distributions.

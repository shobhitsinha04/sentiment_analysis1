**Sentiment Analysis Using VADER and RoBERTa**


This repository contains projects that perform sentiment analysis on multiple datasets, including Amazon reviews and Tweets, using two popular models: VADER (Valence-Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach). It aims to compare the performance of these models in accurately classifying sentiments across various types of data. By utilizing both rule-based (VADER) and deep learning-based (RoBERTa) approaches, the project offers valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model and their applicability to real-world data.

**Models Used**


**VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**


VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

**RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach)**


RoBERTa is a transformer model developed by Facebook AI, which builds on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by optimizing the training process and using more data.

**Key Features:**

1) Sentiment analysis using VADER and RoBERTa.


2) Comparison of model performance.


3) Visualization of sentiment distributions.
